- The versioncode in moodle.config.json has changed from 4 digits to 5 digits to match the actual value for the stores: the 4.0.0 version's versioncode is now 40000 instead of 4000. If you maintain a Moodle plugin with mobile support and you use the versioncode that is sent in every request, you might need to check if this change will affect your code.
- The parameters of the functions confirmAndPrefetchCourse and confirmAndPrefetchCourses have changed, they now accept an object with options.

- There were several breaking changes done in CoreUserDelegate and its handlers:
    The function CoreUserDelegate.getProfileHandlersFor must now receive a context + contextId instead of a courseId.
    The user handler function isEnabledForCourse is now called isEnabledForContext and receives a context + contextId instead of a courseId.
    Some user handler's functions have also changed to accept context + contextId instead of a courseId: isEnabledForUser, getDisplayData, action.
- CoreCourseHelperProvider.openCourse parameters changed, now it admits CoreNavigationOptions + siteId on the same object that includes Params passed to page.
- displaySectionSelector has been deprecated on CoreCourseFormatHandler, use displayCourseIndex instead.
- Most of the functions or callbacks that handle redirects/deeplinks have been modified to accept an object instead of just path + options. E.g.: CoreLoginHelper.isSiteLoggedOut, CoreLoginHelper.openBrowserForSSOLogin, CoreLoginHelper.openBrowserForOAuthLogin, CoreLoginHelper.prepareForSSOLogin, CoreApp.storeRedirect, CoreSites.loadSite.
- Course preview page route has changed from course/:courseId/preview to course/:courseId/summary to match with the page name and characteristics.

=== 3.9.5 ===

- Several functions inside AddonNotificationsProvider have been modified to accept an "options" parameter instead of having several optional parameters.
- Schemas are now registered using Angular providers with the CORE_SITE_SCHEMAS injection token instead of CoreSitesProvider.registerSiteSchema.

=== 3.9.3 ===

- In the core-attachments component, passing a -1 as maxSize or maxSubmissions used to mean "unknown limit". Now -1 means unlimited. Also, passing a 0 to maxSize used to mean "unknown" too, now 0 means user max size.
- Most functions that call a WebService in addons/mod have been modified to accept an "options" parameter instead of having several optional parameters.

=== 3.8.3 ===

- CoreFileProvider.writeFileDataInFile has been deprecated. Please use CoreFileHelperProvider.writeFileDataInFile instead.

=== 3.8.0 ===

- CoreDomUtilsProvider.extractDownloadableFilesFromHtml and CoreDomUtilsProvider.extractDownloadableFilesFromHtmlAsFakeFileObjects have been deprecated. Please use CoreFilepoolProvider.extractDownloadableFilesFromHtml and CoreFilepoolProvider.extractDownloadableFilesFromHtmlAsFakeFileObjects. We had to move them to prevent a circular dependency.

=== 3.7.1 ===

=== 3.7.0 ===

- The pushnotifications addon has been moved to core. All imports of that addon need to be fixed to use the right path and name.
- Now the expirationTime of cache entries contains the time the entry was modified, not the expiration time. This is to allow calculating dynamic expiration times. We decided to reuse the same field to prevent modifying the database table.

=== 3.6.1 ===

- The local notifications plugin was updated to its latest version. The new API has some breaking changes, so please check its documentation if you're using local notifications. Also, you need to run "npm install" to update the ionic-native library.
- New method CoreSitesProvider.registerSiteSchema allows to register table schemas and migration functions for site databases. Prefer this method over CoreSitesProvider.createTablesFromSchema: it supports schema migrations and it tracks the installed version of the schema, so it does not try to create the tables on every app boot.

=== 3.6.0 ===

- gulp was updated to v4. In order for gulp to work, you need to install gulp-cli: npm install -g gulp-cli
  It's also recommended to update ionic cli to v4, otherwise some errors could be raised while building: npm install -g ionic
- The value of the constant CoreCourseProvider.ALL_SECTIONS_ID has changed from -1 to -2.
- Use of completionstatus on the module object has been deprecated, use completiondata instead.
- The function CoreSitesProvider.loadSite has changed, now it will trigger SESSION_EXPIRED event if the site is logged out. Its params and return value have changed.
- When using CoreDomUtils.showAlert, please use alert.didDismiss.subscribe() instead of alert.onDidDismiss().
- The page CoreSharedFilesChooseSitePage now expects to receive the full path to the file (file.toURL()) instead of the relative path.
- The following strings have been deprecated:
    core.dfdaymonthyear. Please use core.strftimedatefullshort instead.
    core.dfdayweekmonth. Please use core.strftimedayshort instead.
    core.dffulldate. Please use core.strftimedaydatetime instead.
    core.dfmediumdate. Please use core.strftimedaydatetime instead.
    core.dftimedate. Please use core.strftimetime instead.
